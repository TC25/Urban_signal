# Urban_signal
Data for urban signal on land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (AT) at country, climate zone, and select regional scales from different sources.

The data are divided into the following directories:

* LST: LST data with and without urban pixels at country scale from different LST dproducts and based on different land cover data by year. 
* AT: AT data with and without urban pixels at country scale based on the default ESA CCI land cover product by year.
* LU: Urban area by country based on different products by country and year.
* MISC: Other variables calculated with and without urban pixels at country scale based on the default ESA CCI land cover product by year.
* FUT: Future projections of urban area by country, year, and SSP.
* REG: LST data with and without urban pixels for select regions from different LST dproducts and based on different land cover data by year. 
* CLIM: LST data with and without urban pixels and urban area for climate zones based on the default ESA CCI land cover product and MODIS LST by year.
* PREIND: Pre-industrial estimates of urban area by country based on the latest HYDE dataset.

In all cases, data for the European and Asian portions of Russia are separately calculated and adjusted to get continental-scale estimates.
